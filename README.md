# TronPulse Application

TronPulse is a FastAPI-based application for interacting with the Tron blockchain network. This document provides instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure you have the following:

- Docker installed on your system
- A properly configured `.env` file with required environment variables

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and populate it with the necessary environment variables:

# Env type

__ENV__=local

# Database Configuration

POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
POSTGRES_HOST=your_db_host
POSTGRES_PORT=your_db_port
POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name

# Application Configuration

APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
APP_PORT=8080
DEBUG=True
RELOAD=True

Replace the placeholders (your_db_user, your_db_password, etc.) with your actual database credentials. 2. Build the Docker Image
Navigate to the root directory of the project and build the Docker image:\

docker build -t tronpulse-app .

3. Run the Docker Container
   After building the image, run the container and map port 8080 on your host to port 8080 in the container:

docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env tronpulse-app

4. Access the Application
   Once the container is running, the application will be accessible at:

http://localhost:8080/api/v1/docs

Additional Notes
Ensure that your database is running and accessible with the credentials provided in the .env file.
If you need to change the port, update the APP_PORT variable in the .env file and the -p flag in the docker run command.

Example .env File
Hereâ€™s an example of a complete .env file:

# Env type

__ENV__=local

# Database Configuration

POSTGRES_USER=admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
POSTGRES_HOST=db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=tronpulse

# Application Configuration

APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
APP_PORT=8080
DEBUG=True
RELOAD=True

Troubleshooting
Docker Build Fails: Ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements-docs.txt.
Application Fails to Start: Check the logs for errors related to database connectivity or missing environment variables.
